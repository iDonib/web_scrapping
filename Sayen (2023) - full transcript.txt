THE INEQUALITIES IN THIS VAST PART OF OUR COUNTRY COME FROM THE PAST, AND MANY ARE STILL HAPPENING TODAY. ANYONE WITH EYES CAN SEE THEM. SINCERITY INTIMATE CHILE IN 1910 Bitch, come here! Follow her! Advertise your product or brand here contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today To the river, let's go! Run! There, let's go! Over there! THREE DAYS EARLIER Thank you! I greet you, Ngen, so I can walk among you. I had a granddaughter who left to study with the winkas for nearly six years to learn what our people have known all along. I had a grandmother. She was very stubborn. You sure have one. You got here just in time for the wüñon tripantu. Yes. José has been fixing your motorcycle, but don't ask me to get on that thing. - Are you okay? - Yes. - Hello! - Hello! - Hello! - Hello, sister! Hello, brother! Hi! Long time, no see! Did you get here well? Very well, brother. - I'm happy you are here. - Thank you, brother. - It's been a long time, sister. - Too long, brother. - It's good to see you! - The pleasure's all mine! Sayen! I thought you were coming back tomorrow. I didn't want to stay any longer because... I wanted to spend the we tripantu with my people. What are you guys laughing at? Dad! Dad! - Sayen! - Dad! - Dad! - Sayen! Dad! Dad! Stand still! Sayen! Damn winka! - Dad! - Sayen! Dad! Dad! She spat on Lihuel and he got mad and started chasing her. But she stopped, and balled up like a caterpillar. Lihuel went flying! Poor thing! I'll apologize when I see him. Sayen, we're all glad you're back. Your grandmother, the community, and especially... José is very glad. His face changed. What? What face? Really. What face? Have you seen the face of a calf? They look like they're in love, right? Don't tease my wenüy. Besides, not a single man in this community seems to age. Starting with you, brother. - Me? - Yeah. I think you may have struck a deal with the wekufe to look so young. Well, I would also like to take this opportunity to welcome you, lamngen Sayen, to your home, with your grandma. Welcome, sister. - Cheers. - Cheers! - Always triumphant! - Always triumphant! And hopefully your return will motivate José to write for his people, and not just the winkas. When haven't I been with my people? When they raid our land and drag us out of our houses. Why isn't that in the papers? And who posts all that on social media? - Sure, social media... - Exactly! I wanna help, but it's not my section. - What's the problem? - This shit is getting worse, peñi. - That's the problem. - Yes. The bastards understand only if we protest. Listen to me, Pedro... We're welcoming my granddaughter... and we end up fighting. It's always wise to know the winkas. Only fools don't want to know the outsiders. I was thinking maybe I could come one of these days and help you with your grandma's warehouse. She's become quite a hoarder since you left. Yeah, I noticed. Or we could go up to the forest like when we were kids. I'm not going away, José. We have time. I would bring you here as a child. Yeah, I remember. Remember what I would tell you? The Creator gave, for us to defend. When the world was born, it put Ngen inside every being so it would never end. Without Ngen, rivers and forests would dry up, the wind would not blow, the fire would go out, and the Earth would disappear. The owner of the mountains lives inside of you. It speaks with sacred words to all living beings here. That's the Mapuche knowledge. The foreigners need to possess the Earth, destroying it, expelling its Ngen and leaving us homeless. The world is simple, but the winkas make it complicated. Can I help you? Hello. We want to see the owner. Ilwen Lemunko. Does she live here? Yes. Why do you need her? Is she a relative of yours? Yes, what do you need her for? We just want to talk to her. Wait here. Grandma! There are people looking for you outside. How are you, ma'am? Have a seat. - What herb is this? - Plantain. My mother gave me plantain tea as a child. Honey? Yes, thank you. How many acres are there? Acres? What is that? It's a word used by the winkas. Pink people like you. Mrs. Ilwen, I'll cut to the chase. Ecosystems like yours are one of a kind. We'd like to talk to you to see how we could help you protect this place. And, in turn, offer you a good deal. For you and the community. You talk a lot, but you don't really say anything. We want to buy your land. Well, not exactly buy. It sounds as if we'd own everything, but that's not the idea. We're interested in buying a part of your land. You can still live here. Nothing will change for you. And you wouldn't only receive a payment well above market value. We can also negotiate a sustainable development program for your community. Exactly. Look... This is the name of the company we represent. Actaeon. It's part of the GreenCorp group. Maybe you've heard of us. We have important projects in several countries. And I'll also give you a proposal. So that you can read it carefully. Your granddaughter can help if you don't understand. Take your time, Mrs. Ilen. Ilwen. Excuse me? Ilwen. Ilwen. Mrs. Ilwen, no rush at all. Please understand we all benefit from this. Very well. Then you get to buy, we get the chance to stay and live here. What do you get from this? Ecotourism based on preservation. But tourism has never been ecological, and forests preserve themselves. You're Spanish, aren't you? The forest lives inside each one of us. I really don't own it. I only guard it. This is a sacred place, set up by our machi for the communities. You are Chilean and you surely know how this works. Why don't you tell the young man here that our people fought for over 500 years precisely against Spain to make this land our home? And now you're asking me to hand it over to a Spaniard simply because he has a very pretty face? Tea's gone cold. By that she means that the conversation is over. - Right. - Let's go. Well... I only ask that you think it over, ma'am. I'll leave you a card with my name, my phone number, and I'll also write down an initial offer. Obviously negotiable. But, like I told you, it has many benefits. And beneficiaries. Good day. You were too forward with her. Have they come before? It's the first time. They have defended their land for a long time and they'll keep doing it. We'll see, Lira. Everybody has a price. You have one, and so do I. That tree has a price. We'll make an offer that they like. Simple. We'll see. Your dad called. He was about to land. Is the place nearby? Like 10 miles, but the road is bad. How did it go with the hag? Like crap. Daddy Máximo will be pissed at his junkie son. Don't talk about what you don't understand. Guys, go get a coffee. - And my package? - Tomorrow. Tomorrow? There were no dealers nearby. I can find one in Santiago. You'll get it tomorrow. Don't worry. I'll always be by your side. Dad. What's up? How are you? How was the flight? All flights are the same, Antonio. We still need to run more tests, but looks to be bigger than the one in Rwanda. Primary cobalt, 6.7%. Interesting. I wanna hear it from Lira. Antonio's right. It seems there's a large amount of cobalt. A geological rarity for this area. "It seems"? How sure are you? Well, we still need to do some tests. I want to drill at 2.8 and repeat the spectrogram. I don't have time! I have those wolves breathing down my neck! Damn it! Máximo, I need to run those tests. Lira, he's right. You're right, Dad. It's a mine of cobalt. We need to approve it. Did you close the deal? Almost. We had problems with the owner, a Mapuche woman. Did she sign or not? Almost, I'm telling you. It's not easy. They don't trust outsiders. It'll take time, but I've got it. That's what worries me. It's not wise, Antonio. Start an operation without certainty? I need to repeat the tests at site D and the hag needs... Lira! Get out. Leave me alone for a second, okay? Yes, the tests confirm there is cobalt. You'll be in charge? I'm up at the lithium site. My son's in charge. - Antonio? Is that going to be a problem? - No. What do our contacts say? Don't worry, I speak with them often. Well, keep me posted. Will do. Shit! Miranda! Bykov! The Indian girl recorded us! - She went down the road! - Bykov! To the trucks! Go left. We'll go right. She's ours! We've got her! - Fuck! She's getting away! - Leave it! Fuck this. Let's go! There she is! Go, go, go! Hey, girl! We know you're there! It's okay! You haven't stolen anything! We won't call the police! Kiddo! Listen! Everyone likes to record things, but our camp is private. We just need your phone to delete what isn't yours. Okay? Who is she? The landowner's granddaughter. Let's go. Grandma! We must tell everyone! Get your things! The men who came by are drilling the mountain. They have weapons! They saw me! What? We have to go now, grandma! We have to let everyone know. The chief, Nawel, and the young ones. We're not going anywhere. They have guns! And you're very angry. Those things should not go together. My granddaughter says you're drilling the land! And that you have guns and machinery! Who authorized you to bring those here? Did she tell you she recorded us? And even stole from us? Valuable things are missing. We could go to the police. My granddaughter is no thief, winka. You are! Don't talk to them, Grandma. All they do is lie. Don't try to fool me. I know exactly what I saw and heard. Drilling, cobalt... If your granddaughter lets me talk, we can explain everything. And I assure you everyone wins. And if after this explanation I can't convince you, we'll pick up our things and go. Look, ma'am, what's below this forest will not only let us protect this land, but the whole damn planet. Am I lying, Lira? Lira's a geologist and Chilean like you. He may be Chilean, but I'm Mapuche. Whatever. Explain to them. - What's there to explain? - Cobalt. Gigantic cobalt deposits. The new gold for a future without polluting vehicles. Exactly. And a solution for your community to educate their children. I'm talking about education, health... We can send them to study abroad. Many people like you have come here offering promises. You're the youngest, that's for sure. I heard him talking to his dad, grandma. We have a scared relationship with what lies beneath this ground. We don't need a commercial relationship. We respect it. But you come here with lies, deception and guns. Go tell your father that If he wants this old lady to sign, he has to come here, on his knees, and kiss my ass. Get the hell out of here! Gather up your things. This place belongs to us! Are we clear now? No! Grandma! Grandma. Grandma. She was going to hit me. You saw it, right? She spat in my face. We have to burn the house with them inside. Okay? We're all guilty here. All of us. We have to cover our tracks. We were never here. Okay? Never. Okay? Move! What are you doing? Are you crazy? This is wrong. I'm out of here! You're already involved. That girl spied on us was probably organizing her people to burn our things and rob us. You think she'll stay put? No, she'll mobilize her friends and bring hell down on us. Rubén. What? Bring her in. - Hello, Ilwen! - Hello! What can I do for you? I didn't bring her. She dragged me here. I want to be a warrior. But you are a woman. Aukan's daughter... I won't do it. I don't train women! Why? Why? Because I don't. Since the dawn of time, warriors have been men. Take her, Ilwen. Please. What if I beat you? You have a strong spirit. But it's not enough. Go away. Who's next? I want to be a warrior like my father! Stop bothering me, girl. Lihuel. Take her out of here. Let me go! Be strong! Get up. Come on, Lihuel. Our training is more than just a way of fighting. You'll learn to be vigilant. Forgetting yourself to help the weak. May our fight persist! I love you, Grandma. Turn the truck around. This is like Rwanda. This is nothing. Rwanda was way worse. Yeah, this is nothing. But don't worry, I have it all under control. Fuck... Fuck, I have to come clean. There goes the bitch! Was I right or what? Lira, you think an Indian girl can just escape like that and blow up a truck? We must find her before she gets others. She went into the woods, she's hurt. We'll catch up to her. - So? - Either we walk 10 miles to camp and risk her talking, or we kill her now. - No. - Why not? She knows the forest, we don't. Come on! All forests are the same. That's your job. To come up with solutions, not problems. If we keep arguing, we'll lose her. Let's hunt that fucking Mapuche. May our fight persist! Sayen! José! With more strength! Make sure they're sharp! Run! Faster! Sayen! Be careful! Get up! Well done! I can see your father's warrior spirit growing in you! Chilean, are you sure she can't come down any other way? So stubborn, Russian. I've told you she can't cross the river. - Hello? - The only bridge is further up. - Hello, honey. - She can't climb that. It's too steep. All she can do is go up, or turn around and run into you. - We should keep going. - We can't move at night with no trail. Unless you wanna break a bone. She can't keep going either. She's not stupid. You're throwing a slumber party? That's so cool! Fun! Okay, pumpkin, have fun. Bye. I couldn't possibly have kids. Or pets. What you should do, Antonio, is call your dad and tell him everything. Once there's good news. Good news? And what would those good news be? That neither myself, nor my team nor Actaeon's star geologist are going to jail. Is that good news, Lira? Don't worry. We'll fix the problem. I'll handle it. She's not the problem. My father is. He only notices when I mess up. That fucker won't ever respect me. If he didn't respect you, you wouldn't be here. This is big, Antonio. A cobalt deposit. This isn't an easy job. He doesn't have the balls to come here. He's doing other things. He's up north right now. Come on. Let's camp here tonight. Tomorrow is a new day. Boss. Let's get some rest. Do the first watch. Damn winka. Traitor. I'm just hired help. I'm the driver. What were you going to do? Let them burn me alive? No! No, no, no. Don't shoot. She's mine. Fucking bitch. Hey! Come back! Calm down. We don't wanna hurt you. Okay? We'll go to the police and report this. I'll admit, she's got balls. CALLING MAXIMO Your father. - Dad. - You're not at the camp and Bykov doesn't answer. What's up? A lady attacked us. You said they were dangerous. They got violent. What? What lady? What are you talking about? She had an accident. It was self-defense. I have witnesses. I'm on it. Put Bykov on. Dad, we're driving. I said to put Bykov on the phone right now. I shouldn't have sent you. Not after what happened in Africa. - Yes, sir? - Bykov! What the fuck is going on? It's delicate. - There's a witness. - Fuck. Fuck. You just had to keep Antonio in check. You know his mood swings the most. You're like a father to him! You just had to keep him in check! Yes, Mr. Torres, I was careless. Listen to me carefully. I can't hear you. Bykov, listen! Fuck this. What'd he say? He said nothing. Let's get moving. - What do you mean? - Come on. Sayen. Where is Sayen? - I don't know. - Sayen... I don't know. They're taking her out! Hey, leave the body there! - The machi isn't here yet! - What are you doing? - Wait for the machi! Damn winkas. - Wait for the machi! Have some respect, winkas! Damn winkas. An attack? Yes, my son and his group were ambushed. It seems a man's been badly hurt. They must have had bad reception, and we got cut off. I suspect it might have been a terrorist attack. Manríquez, Salazar and I are counting on you. Leave it to me, Mr. Torres. Captain. There's a body. It's Ilwen Lemunko, the house's owner. Let the police work and clear the place. - Yes, sir. - Governor! Please! - Governor! - Hey! Easy, let him through. - Who are you? - José Huenupe. Journalist and a friend of Ilwen Lemunko's. Governor, Sayen Coñuepán, her granddaughter, was with her and she's missing. - They did something to her. - Can you describe her to us? Anything to help us find her. Governor, please understand, this wasn't an accident. They hurt her. She wouldn't leave her. Dead or alive. Ilwen Lemunko was murdered, and burned. Let the police and inspectors work. - They won't help. - Captain. Let him go! Let him go! Let him go! When you talk to the press, Sayen Coñuepán is a terrorist, a danger to society. She's murdered Ilwen Lemunko and probably a group of foreign scientists. - Is that clear? - Yes. Not so fast. Rubén, you slow us down. You understand? We'll return. - Take me. - We have the coordinates. Why don't you take me to the camp? There's an infirmary there. Sit there. Keep still. You'll be fine. No way. What if the girl comes for me? You're no use to her. You'll be fine. Lira, no! Lira, no... Mr. Antonio! Boss! Fucking asshole! Asshole! If I go down, we all go down. Hello, big brother! Big brother! Lira, change that attitude. This is a test for us as a team. As my father would say, it's a chance to get out of our comfort zone. Come on, let's go. Miranda! How's Rubén? Sleeping. And they said Chile was boring. Are all women here are the same? Like you and like the Mapuche girl? Dangerous? I might come get myself one. Maybe she'll kill you in your sleep. Are you flirting with me? - Look. - It has to be her. There must be a way to cross. Let's go. - Stay there! - Hold on. Hands up. Easy, man. Don't move. Hand over your guns. Easy, dude. Kick your guns. - Kick your guns! - Calm down. I won't! Give me your guns! Kick it over! Cuff your partner. Put that down. Cuff yourself. There. Now, on your knees, fucking pigs. Get on your knees! We'll get you, asshole. Cuff that one to the car, fucker. Calm down, dude. Who's got the keys? Throw them this way. Calm down, man. Careful with that. Don't leave us here. Stay there and don't move! Motherfucker! Let's go. Pepi! You're a warrior now, brother! Silence, man. Remember that burned truck at Ilwen's? Yes. It belongs to a mining company. Actaeon. The owners haven't reported it stolen or missing. - And the passengers? - Nothing. We must look for Sayen. She's in danger. No, they are in danger! Let's go to Ilwen's. They'll look for us there. Let's gear up. Don't touch it! It could be poisoned. Step away. Step away. Shit! Don't shoot! Save the bullets! We'll need them. A fucking arrow! She's gonna kill us all. - Miranda, pull it out. - Don't touch it. - Pull it out. - No! Leave it. Pull the damn thing out! Motherfucker! This was a decoy. She's hunting us. The fucking Indian girl is hunting us. We're wasting time. Let's go. Where are you going? Another river. Are you kidding? - You okay? - I'm fine. Let's keep going. Can you explain to me why the fuck it's so hard to find this bitch? I have my men on it. The forest is complex with way too much unexplored land. Once we find her, we must control the narrative. Any tweet, any article linking this operation to this issue and we're fucked. The investors are gonna flee like rats. That's not good. That's not good for me, for Actaeon, or for you, understand? Her grandmother agreed to sell the land but the girl didn't accept it. She killed herself out of guilt. Good. Now, about your son, we are looking, but... My son can wait. Take care of her. Miranda! Bykov! Miranda! Remember the faces of those winkas? Your hand still shaking? Leave him alone, Pedro. I'm just thanking him. Thank you, brother. Beats screwing around in an office? This asshole never shuts up, does he? That's right, brother. A tupu! Ilwen's tupu. - Yes. - That's right. The tracks go in that direction. Hey! This is the winkas' doing. A dead winka will bring the military. But if we find out who did it... He still doesn't get it. This isn't our fault. Here in Wallmapu, everything that happens is our fault. We have to keep a cool head. Yes. We need to find Sayen. - If they find her before we do... - Now you're using your head. You're finally learning. If you move, you'll choke! The Indian is well trained. She knows the forest. We're going in circles. Yes, but you are trained too. I'm serious. I'm supposed to feel safe with you. Aren't I, soldier? If you bring her to me... I'll write you a check with plenty of zeros. I'll find her. Want to know who killed your grandma? She was right. Antonio is just the messenger. Do you want to know... who sent the message? This is the north. Yes. And this? Move. The nearest town is 20 miles away. It's Brazil. Brazil, the north of Chile, and Africa. Actaeon is everywhere. No. Only in impoverished countries. Who's this next to Antonio? I ran out of patience. - Bye. - Máximo Torres Esquídez. - Antonio's dad. - Does he know what's going on? He's my boss. Do you know who this is? That's how they work. They bribe politicians, lobbyists, even presidents. To do business in the Third World, you have to invest a lot of money. There's other companies bigger and more powerful than Actaeon that are preying on natural resources elsewhere. Why would I trust you? I'm sorry about your grandmother. I am truly sorry. Get me out alive. I have children. I have a family, a wife. They're waiting for me. You and your crew murdered my grandmother. You murdered her, you burned her body. You'd have done the same to me. You're murderers! Mercenaries. I can help you, woman. I can help you get your revenge. Get me out alive, and I'll do it. Hello. Where is Sayen? Are you her friends? Who's asking? Pedro! Run away, José! Find Sayen! Lira! Let's go. Pedro... Pedro... José. He's alive. He's still on the mountain. He's... José. José. - She wasn't at the funeral? - No. None of the men saw her. MÁXIMO TORRES INCOMING CALL The fugitive is dangerous. Don't try to capture her alive if it endangers your men. Our priority is the safety of the community. Am I clear? Yes, sir. Excuse me. Good morning, Sayen. It was so easy. You just had to take the money. But no. "The fiercest warriors of all, fighting for 500 years", blah-blah. Are you afraid, murderer? You should be. I have a future. What do you have? Your dad doesn't think so. What do you know about him? I heard him talk to you. And I know he's worse than you. Lira came clean. He told me how in Rwanda you and your friends killed people, children, and all because of you. He also told me about your addictions, your instability. You're a psychopath! You think I didn't study your people? I like to know the history of who I do business with. It means "warrior"? Tell me... What were you trained for? To protect what? This? I'll tell you something no one says in this world of cowards and offended people. Nobody cares about your damn forest! You think the ignorant masses want a tree over an electric car, a cell phone, a screen? No. Then what are you fighting for? You and your mercenary friends murdered my people. You murdered my grandma. I'm going to kill you. You and your dad. I'm really sorry, okay? I had no choice. Although one got away. - José. - And you... are gonna help me find him. Is he your boyfriend? He's not man enough for you. Look, I'll give you some advice. Find yourself a real man. I read your people ate the hearts of their strongest enemies to capture their energy. If I eat yours, will I be braver? You're not Mapuche. I love how you smell. You smell... raw. Kill me. Kill me and you won't leave the forest alive. Fucking bitch. Son of a bitch! Fuck. Okay. If she wants to play, we'll play. They pay off politicians, destroy communities. Lira told me. Antonio is a pawn in this conspiracy. He and his dad must pay. - We must bring justice. - Justice? What justice? When has justice ever done any good? What will you do? Kill them all? One by one? You'll end up in jail like your dad. - My dad is innocent. - But you aren't, Sayen. There's no turning back. Don't get in my way. It's not black and white. How many more need to be killed? Ilwen? Pedro? Nawel? I don't want you to be next. It won't bring your grandma back. I'm tired. I'm tired, José. You were always stronger than me. And I don't mean your kick. - You were never afraid. - I learned to hide it. I was never going to be a weychafe. As a journalist, I can be of more use. José, you just saved my life. - Let me help you. - How? How, José? Look... You saw who was in those pictures. It won't be enough to bring down Actaeon. They can't walk free. They can't go unpunished. No, we'll have to investigate. Go beyond what's going on here in Wallmapu. Look, if you kill the Torres, two people die and you're a terrorist. But if we can uncover this conspiracy, we can help more people, more communities. More people like Ilwen. I found this on the ground. My grandma is dead. If I hadn't followed them... It's my fault. I let her down. It wasn't your fault, Sayen. - It wasn't your fault. - Yes. I failed her. - No! - Run, Sayen! - No! - Run! Now! Bitch! Sayen Coñuepán, you're under arrest! Release the hostage! Surrender immediately or we'll have to open fire! You're accused of the murders of Ilwen Lemunko, Rubén Anticura and our colleague Manuel González! Return to the shore immediately! It was simple! All you had to do was sign, but no! You and I are the same. No. We're not. My father loves me! - Fisk. - Máximo. Business in the south hit a wall. I'm going back to Atacama. What's this about a Mapuche terrorist? Sayen Coñuepán? Don't worry. It's a local issue. We knew the area was tricky. I don't need to tell you that this can't happen in the north, right? - Of course. - By the way... - My condolences for your son Antonio. - Yeah, thanks. - Where you headed, boy? - North. - Does Talca work for you? - Yes. - Get in. - Thank you. Sayen Coñuepán may be the leader... - What's your name? - José. To kidnap foreigners to trade them or her father, Aukan Coñuepán, who is currently serving time under the antiterrorist law. Along with her group, she allegedly murdered police officer Manuel González, whose body was found in the forest, and driver Rubén Anticura, a family man... NORTH - SANTIAGO - SOUTH
